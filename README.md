# Julia_imzML_GUI
A graphical User Interface created with Julia Genie Builder made for this repository: https://github.com/CINVESTAV-LABI/julia_mzML_imzML that generates images with the imzML files.
For this to work you must also download that repository, rename it to julia_mzML_imzML and add it to the "public" folder inside inside this repository.
